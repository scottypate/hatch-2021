# HATCH 2021

This repository gives an overview of commonly used tools and libraries for scientific analysis with python for the [HudsonAlpha tech challenge](https://hudsonalpha.org/techchallenge/). These libraries are not meant to be an exhaustive collection, rather some of the most common frameworks. The [examples](./examples) directory contains demonstration code of some of these tools and libraries.

### Typical Scientific Python Data Packages

1. Scikit - Package for data processing and machine learning. 
2. Numpy - Matrix operations.
3. Pandas - Data loading and transformation.
4. Tensorflow - Tensor operations for neural networks. 

### Image Processing Python Packages

1. opencv-python - Package with lots of utility functions for manipulating images and video.
2. PySDL2 - Library used to generate animations/renderings. 
3. scikit-image - Commonly used image processing functions for ML applications.

### Geographic Python Packages

1. Geopandas - Extends pandas data manipulation to geographic data
2. Shapely - Python utility to manipulate geometric data.
3. Rtree - spatial indexing for python

### Examples

#### SLAM Example - [Source](https://github.com/geohot/twitchslam)

Use video and image processing libraries to demonstrate SLAM modeling.

#### Hurricane Katrina Example - [Source](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/geospatial-data-python)

Use various libraries shown here to examine data from Hurricane Katrina.

#### Predicting Hurricane Path. 

Can we use past hurricane data to determine the path of a new hurricane?
